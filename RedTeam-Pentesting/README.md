# 🔓 Red Teaming & Penetration Testing – Internship Report

This report dives into red team practices like password cracking, wordlist generation, and password analysis. I explored offensive security tools like **Hashcat**, **Syngsong**, and **zxcvbn** in a controlled environment.

---

## 📌 Objective

To understand and simulate red team tactics — from generating targeted wordlists to cracking encrypted passwords and analyzing their complexity.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

- Syngsong (lyrical wordlist generator)
- Hashcat (password cracker)
- zxcvbn (password complexity evaluator)
- Python + Genius API

---

## 🚀 Tasks Performed

### 🔡 1. Password List Generation – Syngsong
- Used Genius API to pull song lyrics
- Created a custom wordlist from favorite artist (Juice WRLD)

### 🔐 2. Password Hashing & Cracking
- Created an MD5 hash of a sample password
- Used Hashcat with generated wordlist to crack it

### 🧠 3. Password Strength Analysis
- Used zxcvbn to evaluate password strength
- Interpreted score based on entropy, patterns, and dictionary presence

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- Wordlist generation can be highly targeted and creative
- Practical use of Hashcat and how masks affect cracking
- Password complexity ≠ security — analysis tools help explain why
- Ethical hacking principles and responsible tool use
