# 🏢 Tutelr Internship Reports – by Astra

This repository showcases three technical security assessments I completed during my internship at Tutelr. It documents my learning journey through real-world tasks involving Windows configuration auditing, forensic workstation deployment, and offensive security tooling — including password cracking and analysis. Each report is organized in its own folder with practical insights, tools used, and lessons learned.
